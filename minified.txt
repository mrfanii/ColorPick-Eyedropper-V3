1) The single instance of innerHTML is never called - Cr.ent is the only code that can possibly reach this and it is unused. https://github.com/qufighter/Cr

2) The sha1.js file

\data\sha1.js

is taken from the crypto-js library on google code
https://code.google.com/p/crypto-js/downloads/list

CryptoJS v3.1.2/rollups/sha1.js
That is the exact file embedded in this extension


Thanks!
